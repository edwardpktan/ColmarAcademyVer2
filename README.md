●	What did you like about this project?
On 2nd attempt, I took about an accumulative of 15 hours to understand and complete this project. I have a better understanding of the uses of different property and their value, and the importance of a style reset when creating different breakpoints with the same HTML codes. 
●	What did you struggle with in this project?
Debugging my errors. Once I debugged and understand, it’s likely that I’ll remember it from now on. I am really learning as I am practicing while making loads of mistakes. It’s frustrating, but most effective way to learn well. I also realized that it may be better to use padding instead of margin to create space, to better manage creating different breakpoints. Or I could just reset the style. 
●	What would make your experience with this assessment better?
5 hours is insufficient to fully complete this project on my first attempt. But I understand this is an assessment of student’s competency thus far.
